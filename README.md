# life expectancy website

This is a project for my stats class. It uses a svg of the US and its counties 
to show the relationship between where you live and how long you live. 
The data is segmented into male and female and shows information from the years
1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. It runs using flask and has no external depencencies beyond that.
to run the website download flask using pip and run the below command from the root of the repository.

```console
$ flask run --app stats-web.py
```
